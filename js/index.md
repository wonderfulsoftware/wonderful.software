:::info About this draft
I have always wanted to write an intro to programming book since I first registered this domain back in 2015, but I never have the needed push to finally do it. In 2023, thanks to a collaboration with Skooldio and CU, I am finally developing a free video course about intro to programming with JS. This section of the site serves as the draft (for getting early feedback) and the textual version of the course contents (for people who prefer reading). When the video couse is finally released, this website will be updated with the link to it.
